# The Story
---------------------------------
The CSUN portal has always been complained about by students and faculty alike.
Some time during my senior year, they forcefully added two-factor authentication to all CSUN folks.
In a nutshell, it sucks, like reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllly sucks. 
So if I wanted to search for classes or just look around at the professors, I would need to login,
pull my out g\*\*d\*\*m f***ing phone to hit **accept** to access information that would be perfectly fine in the eyes of the public.

However, I am a student of the school and there is not much I can do to CSUN or their portals and websites or whatever the f**k that would make my life easier, but there is always something I can do with *with* what I am provided. 

After some digging, I found out there is a link to actual portal search tool widget thingy that we use to search for classes.

Funny enough as I am writing this damn thing, the server is down. Giving me more reasons to angrily bash my loud ass mechnical keyboard typing this up like anybody is gonna care.
